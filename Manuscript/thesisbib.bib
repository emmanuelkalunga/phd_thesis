	volume = {51},
	abstract = {Interest in developing a new method of man-to-machine communication-a brain-computer interface (BCI)-has grown steadily over the past few decades. BCIs create a new communication channel between the brain and an output device by bypassing conventional motor output pathways of nerves and muscles. These systems use signals recorded from the scalp, the surface of the cortex, or from inside the brain to enable users to control a variety of applications including simple word-processing software and orthotics. BCI technology could therefore provide a new communication and control option for individuals who cannot otherwise express their wishes to the outside world. Signal processing and classification methods are essential tools in the development of improved BCI technology. We organized the BCI Competition 2003 to evaluate the current state of the art of these tools. Four laboratories well versed in EEG-based BCI research provided six data sets in a documented format. We made these data sets (i.e., labeled training sets and unlabeled test sets) and their descriptions available on the Internet. The goal in the competition was to maximize the performance measure for the test labels. Researchers worldwide tested their algorithms and competed for the best classification results. This paper describes the six data sets and the results and function of the most successful algorithms.},

Classical BCI application are brain actuated tools for patients such as prostheses (see Section 4.1) or mental text entry systems ([2] and see [3,4,5,6] for an overview on BCI). In these applications the BBCI uses natural motor competences of the users and specifically tailored pattern recognition algorithms for detecting the user's intent. But beyond rehabilitation, there is a wide range of possible applications in which BCI technology is used to monitor other mental states, often even covert ones (see also [7] in the fMRI realm). While this field is still largely unexplored, two examples from our studies are exemplified in Section 4.3 and 4.4.},

Therefore spatial filters are extremely useful in single-trial analysis in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. There are powerful methods from machine learning and signal processing that permit the optimization of spatio-temporal filters for each subject in a data dependent fashion beyond the fixed filters based on the sensor geometry, e.g., Laplacians. Here we elucidate the theoretical background of the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, a popular method in brain-computer interface (BCD research. Apart from reviewing several variants of the basic algorithm, we reveal tricks of the trade for achieving a powerful CSP performance, briefly elaborate on theoretical aspects of CSP, and demonstrate the application of CSP-type preprocessing in our studies of the Berlin BCI (BBCI) project.},

In this paper we are discussing work done in the area of hand gesture recognition where focus is on the soft computing based methods like artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, etc. We also described hand detection methods in the preprocessed image for detecting the hand image. Most researchers used fingertips for hand detection in appearance based modeling. Finally we are comparing results given by different researchers after their implementation.},

	volume = {89},
	abstract = {After about 30 years of research on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) there is little knowledge about the phenomenon, that some people - healthy as well as individuals with disease – are not able to learn BCI-control. To elucidate this " BCI-inefficiency" phenomenon, the current study investigated whether psychological parameters, such as attention span, personality or motivation, could predict performance in a single session with a BCI controlled by modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) with motor imagery. A total of N = 83 healthy BCI novices took part in the session. Psychological parameters were measured with an electronic test-battery including clinical, personality and performance tests. Predictors were determined by binary logistic regression analyses. The output variable of the Two-Hand Coordination Test (2HAND) {\textbackslash}" overall mean error duration{\textbackslash}" which is a measure for the accuracy of fine motor skills accounted for 11\% of the variance in BCI-inefficiency. The Attitudes Towards Work (AHA) test variable {\textbackslash}"performance level{\textbackslash}" which can be interpreted as a degree of concentration and a neurophysiological SMR predictor were also identified as significant predictors of SMR BCI performance. Psychological parameters as measured in this study play a moderate role for one-session performance in a BCI controlled by modulation of SMR. Fine motor skills predict SMR-BCI performance. The amount of concentration predicts SMR-BCI performance. Biological, psychological and physiological factors lead to an explanation of 30\% of the variance in SMR-BCI performance.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the OpenViBE software platform which enables researchers to design, test, and use brain?computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs are communication systems that enable users to send commands to computers solely by means of brain activity. BCIs are gaining interest among the virtual reality (VR) community since they have appeared as promising interaction devices for virtual environments (VEs). The key features of the platform are (1) high modularity, (2) embedded tools for visualization and feedback based on VR and 3D displays, (3) BCI design made available to non-programmers thanks to visual programming, and (4) various tools offered to the different types of users. The platform features are illustrated in this paper with two entertaining VR applications based on a BCI. In the first one, users can move a virtual ball by imagining hand movements, while in the second one, they can control a virtual spaceship using real or imagined foot movements. Online experiments with these applications together with the evaluation of the platform computational performances showed its suitability for the design of VR applications controlled with a BCI. OpenViBE is a free software distributed under an open-source license.},

Although finger-tip touch based user interface has paved a main stream in mobile electronics, we envision touch-less HMI as a promising technology in futuristic applications with higher potential in areas where sanity or outdoor operation become of importance. In this paper, we introduce a novel HMI device for non-contact gesture input for intuitive HMI experiences. The enabling technology of the proposed device is the IPA (infrared Proximity Array) sensor by which realtime 3 dimensional depth information can be captured and realized for machine control. For the usability study, two different operating modes are adopted for hand motion inputs: one is a finger tip control mode and the other is a palm control mode. Throughput of the proposed device has been studied and compared to a traditional mouse device for usability evaluation. During the human subject test, the proposed device is found to be useful for PC mouse pointer control. The experimental results are shared in the paper as well.},

One of the biggest challenges in BCI research is to understand and solve the problem of {\textbackslash}"BCI Illiteracy{\textbackslash}", which is that BCI control does not work for a non-negligible portion of users (estimated 15 to 30\%). Here, we investigate the illiteracy problem in BCI systems which are based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. In this paper, a sophisticated adaptation scheme is presented which guides the user from an initial subject-independent classifier that operates on simple features to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts the whole time with the same feedback application. While initial runs use supervised adaptation methods for robust co-adaptive learning of user and machine, final runs use unsupervised adaptation and therefore provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, which does not involve any offline calibration measurement, good performance was obtained by good BCI participants (also one novice) after 3-6 min of adaptation. More importantly, the use of machine learning techniques allowed users who were unable to achieve successful feedback before to gain significant control over the BCI system. In particular, one participant had no peak of the sensory motor idle rhythm in the beginning of the experiment, but could develop such peak during the course of the session (and use voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application).},

	abstract = {Objective. Although extensive studies have shown improvement in spelling accuracy, the conventional P300 speller often exhibits errors, which occur in almost the same row or column relative to the target. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) approach by incorporating the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) into the conventional P300 paradigm. Approach. We designed a periodic stimuli mechanism and superimposed it onto the P300 stimuli to increase the difference between the symbols in the same row or column. Furthermore, we integrated the random flashings and periodic flickers to simultaneously evoke the P300 and SSVEP, respectively. Finally, we developed a hybrid detection mechanism based on the P300 and SSVEP in which the target symbols are detected by the fusion of three-dimensional, time-frequency features. Main results. The results obtained from 12 healthy subjects show that an online classification accuracy of 93.85\% and information transfer rate of 56.44 bit/min were achieved using the proposed BCI speller in only a single trial. Specifically, 5 of the 12 subjects exhibited an information transfer rate of 63.56 bit/min with an accuracy of 100\%. Significance . The pilot studies suggested that the proposed BCI speller could achieve a better and more stable system performance compared with the conventional P300 speller, and it is promising for achieving quick spelling in stimulus-driven BCI applications.},

We consider the problem of constructing a representation for data lying on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for representing the high-dimensional data. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality-preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Some potential applications and illustrative examples are discussed.},

	abstract = {Although a crucial role of the fusiform gyrus (FG) in face processing has been demonstrated with a variety of methods, converging evidence suggests that face processing involves an interactive and overlapping processing cascade in distributed brain areas. Here we examine the spatio-temporal stages and their functional tuning to face inversion, presence and configuration of inner features, and face contour in healthy subjects during passive viewing. Anatomically-constrained magnetoencephalography (aMEG) combines high-density whole-head MEG recordings and distributed source modeling with high-resolution structural MRI. Each person's reconstructed cortical surface served to constrain noise-normalized minimum norm inverse source estimates. The earliest activity was estimated to the occipital cortex at {\textasciitilde}100 ms after stimulus onset and was sensitive to an initial coarse level visual analysis. Activity in the right-lateralized ventral temporal area (inclusive of the FG) peaked at {\textasciitilde}160 ms and was largest to inverted faces. Images containing facial features in the veridical and rearranged configuration irrespective of the facial outline elicited intermediate level activity. The M160 stage may provide structural representations necessary for downstream distributed areas to process identity and emotional expression. However, inverted faces additionally engaged the left ventral temporal area at {\textasciitilde}180 ms and were uniquely subserved by bilateral processing. This observation is consistent with the dual route model and spared processing of inverted faces in prosopagnosia. The subsequent deflection, peaking at {\textasciitilde}240 ms in the anterior temporal areas bilaterally, was largest to normal, upright faces. It may reflect initial engagement of the distributed network subserving individuation and familiarity. These results support dynamic models suggesting that processing of unfamiliar faces in the absence of a cognitive task is subserved by a distributed and interactive neural circuit.},

In this study, human subjects learned to use two channels of bipolar EEG activity to control 2-dimensional movement of a cursor on a computer screen. Amplitudes of 8–12 Hz activity in the EEG recorded from the scalp across right and left central sulci were determined by fast Fourier transform and combined to control vertical and horizontal cursor movements simultaneously. This independent control of two separate EEG channels cannot be attributed to a non-specific change in brain activity and appeared to be specific to the mu rhythm frequency range. With further development, multichannel EEG-based communication may prove of significant value to those with severe motor disabilities.},

Given the very low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, a signal enhancement phase is crucial for ensuring decent performances in BCI systems. Several methods have been proposed for EEG signal enhancement, such as Independent Component Analysis, Common Spatial Pattern, and Principal Component Analysis. We show that Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), initially introduced to SSVEP-based BCI as a feature extraction method, is a good candidate for such preprocessing state. Evaluation is performed on a recording from 5 subjects during a BCI task based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP). The authors demonstrate that CCA significantly improves classification performances in SSVEP-based BCIs.},

We define a new methodology in the context of assistive robotics: it is an hybrid approach where a physical interface is complemented by a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). An implementation of such methodology is proposed, using a 3D touchless interface for continuous control and a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI for triggering specific actions. We describe a novel algorithm for classification of SSVEP signals based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Its reliability and robustness are assessed in an online setup and its results are compared to existing algorithms. Finally, an experimental evaluation of the proposed system is performed with a 3D navigation task in a Virtual Environment (VE). The system is also embedded on an assistive robotic arm exoskeleton to validate its feasibility.},

	abstract = {Cognitive monitoring is an approach utilizing realtime brain signal decoding (RBSD) for gaining information on the ongoing cognitive user state. In recent decades this approach has brought valuable insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated RBSD can be used to set up a brain-computer interface (BCI) providing a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain activity. In BCIs the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands to control the connected computer system or to communicate through it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing BCI technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional states to the technical system. We call this approach passive BCI. In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive BCI, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from BCI technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users, and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with BCI technology is very similar to the concept of BCIs itself we propose a unifying categorization of BCI-based applications, including the novel approach of passive BCI.},

The present study examines the specificity of word activation in dyslexic children in 3rd grade by comparing early components of brain potentials elicited by visually presented words vs. strings of meaningless letter-like symbols. Results showed a more pronounced N1 component for words compared to symbols for both groups. The dyslexic group revealed larger left-lateralized, word-specific N1 responses than the typically reading group. Furthermore, positive correlations between N1 amplitudes and reading fluency were found in the dyslexic group. Our results support the notion of N1 as a sensitive index of visual word processing involved in reading fluency.},

	abstract = {The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10× more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

	abstract = {If the basis for cognition lies in the brain, how can it be that the self-designated most cognitively able of animals—us, of course—is not the one endowed with the largest brain? The logic behind the paradox is simple: because brains are made of neurons, it seems reasonable to expect larger brains to be made of larger numbers of neurons; if neurons are the computational units of the brain, then larger brains, made of larger numbers of neurons, should have larger computational abilities than smaller brains. By this logic, humans should not rank even an honorable second in cognitive abilities among animals: at about 1.5 kg, the human brain is two- to threefold smaller than the elephant brain and four- to sixfold smaller than the brains of several cetaceans (Tower, 1954; Marino, 1998). Nevertheless, we are so convinced of our primacy that we carry it explicitly in the name given by Linnaeus to the mammalian order to which we belong—Primata, meaning “first rank,” and we are seemingly the only animal species concerned with developing entire research programs to study itself.},

ECoG signals were recorded with a high-density 32-electrode grid over the hand and arm area of the left sensorimotor cortex. The participant was able to voluntarily activate his sensorimotor cortex using attempted movements, with distinct cortical activity patterns for different segments of the upper limb. Using only brain activity, the participant achieved robust control of 3D cursor movement. The ECoG grid was explanted 28 days post-implantation with no adverse effect. This study demonstrates that ECoG signals recorded from the sensorimotor cortex can be used for real-time device control in paralyzed individuals.},

	abstract = {Objective. Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals have emerged as a potential control signal for brain–computer interface (BCI) applications due to balancing signal quality and implant invasiveness. While there have been numerous demonstrations in which ECoG signals were used to decode motor movements and to develop BCI systems, the extent of information that can be decoded has been uncertain. Therefore, we sought to determine if ECoG signals could be used to decode kinematics (speed, velocity, and position) of arm movements in 3D space. Approach. To investigate this, we designed a 3D center-out reaching task that was performed by five epileptic patients undergoing temporary placement of ECoG arrays. We used the ECoG signals within a hierarchical partial-least squares (PLS) regression model to perform offline prediction of hand speed, velocity, and position. Main Results. The hierarchical PLS regression model enabled us to predict hand speed, velocity, and position during 3D reaching movements from held-out test sets with accuracies above chance in each patient with mean correlation coefficients between 0.31 and 0.80 for speed, 0.27 and 0.54 for velocity, and 0.22 and 0.57 for position. While beta band power changes were the most significant features within the model used to classify movement and rest, the local motor potential and high gamma band power changes, were the most important features in the prediction of kinematic parameters. Significance. We believe that this study represents the first demonstration that truly three-dimensional movements can be predicted from ECoG recordings in human patients. Furthermore, this prediction underscores the potential to develop BCI systems with multiple degrees of freedom in human patients using ECoG.},

Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

The activity of motor cortex (MI) neurons conveys movement intent sufficiently well to be used as a control signal to operate artificial devices, but until now this has called for extensive training or has been confined to a limited movement repertoire. Here we show how activity from a few (7–30) MI neurons can be decoded into a signal that a monkey is able to use immediately to move a computer cursor to any new position in its workspace (14° 14° visual angle). Our results, which are based on recordings made by an electrode array that is suitable for human use, indicate that neurally based control of movement may eventually be feasible in paralysed humans.},

In this study, subjects had real-time visual feedback of their brain-controlled trajectories. Cell tuning properties changed when used for brain-controlled movements.

Their performance in this task improved over a period of weeks.

Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or 15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.},

To translate preclinical results from intact animals to a clinically useful NMP, movement signals must persist in cortex after spinal cord injury and be engaged by movement intent when sensory inputs and limb movement are long absent. Furthermore, NMPs would require that intention-driven neuronal activity be converted into a control signal that enables useful tasks. Here we show initial results for a tetraplegic human (MN) using a pilot NMP. Neuronal ensemble activity recorded through a 96-microelectrode array implanted in primary motor cortex demonstrated that intended hand motion modulates cortical spiking patterns three years after spinal cord injury. Decoders were created, providing a 'neural cursor' with which MN opened simulated e-mail and operated devices such as a television, even while conversing. Furthermore, MN used neural control to open and close a prosthetic hand, and perform rudimentary actions with a multi-jointed robotic arm. These early results suggest that NMPs based upon intracortical neuronal ensemble spiking activity could provide a valuable new neurotechnology to restore independence for humans with paralysis.},

	abstract = {Paralysis following spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other disorders can disconnect the brain from the body, eliminating the ability to perform volitional movements. A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.},

	abstract = {Motor cortex plays a substantial role in driving movement, yet the details underlying this control remain unresolved. We analyzed the extent to which movement-related information could be extracted from single-trial motor cortical activity recorded while monkeys performed center-out reaching. Using information theoretic techniques, we found that single units carry relatively little speed-related information compared with direction-related information. This result is not mitigated at the population level: simultaneously recorded population activity predicted speed with significantly lower accuracy relative to direction predictions. Furthermore, a unit-dropping analysis revealed that speed accuracy would likely remain lower than direction accuracy, even given larger populations. These results suggest that the instantaneous details of single-trial movement speed are difficult to extract using commonly assumed coding schemes. This apparent paucity of speed information takes particular importance in the context of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which rely on extracting kinematic information from motor cortex. Previous studies have highlighted subjects' difficulties in holding a BMI cursor stable at targets. These studies, along with our finding of relatively little speed information in motor cortex, inspired a speed-dampening Kalman filter (SDKF) that automatically slows the cursor upon detecting changes in decoded movement direction. Effectively, SDKF enhances speed control by using prevalent directional signals, rather than requiring speed to be directly decoded from neural activity. SDKF improved success rates by a factor of 1.7 relative to a standard Kalman filter in a closed-loop BMI task requiring stable stops at targets. BMI systems enabling stable stops will be more effective and user-friendly when translated into clinical applications.},

We demonstrate here for the first time that electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded from the surface of the brain can enable users to control a one-dimensional computer cursor rapidly and accurately. We first identified ECoG signals that were associated with different types of motor and speech imagery. Over brief training periods of 3-24 min, four patients then used these signals to master closed-loop control and to achieve success rates of 74-100\% in a one-dimensional binary task. In additional open-loop experiments, we found that ECoG signals at frequencies up to 180 Hz encoded substantial information about the direction of two-dimensional joystick movements. Our results suggest that an ECoG-based BCI could provide for people with severe motor disabilities a non-muscular communication and control option that is more powerful than EEG-based BCIs and is potentially more stable and less traumatic than BCIs that use electrodes penetrating the brain.},

	abstract = {We review recent methodological developments within a parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) framework for reconstructing intracranial sources of extracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data under linear Gaussian assumptions. The PEB framework offers a natural way to integrate multiple constraints (spatial priors) on this inverse problem, such as those derived from different modalities (e.g., from functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) or from multiple replications (e.g., subjects). Using variations of the same basic generative model, we illustrate the application of PEB to three cases: (1) symmetric integration (fusion) of MEG and EEG; (2) asymmetric integration of MEG or EEG with fMRI, and (3) group-optimization of spatial priors across subjects. We evaluate these applications on multi-modal data acquired from 18 subjects, focusing on energy induced by face perception within a time–frequency window of 100–220 ms, 8–18 Hz. We show the benefits of multi-modal, multi-subject integration in terms of the model evidence and the reproducibility (over subjects) of cortical responses to faces.},

Thus, BCIs may offer patients who have lost all voluntary muscle control the only possible way to communicate. Many recent studies have demonstrated that BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG) can allow healthy and severely paralyzed individuals to communicate. While this approach is safe and inexpensive, communication is slow. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides signals with higher spatiotemporal resolution than EEG, and could thus be used to explore whether these improved signal properties translate into increased BCI communication speed. In this study, we investigated the utility of an MEG-based BCI that uses voluntary amplitude modulation of sensorimotor μ and β rhythms. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, we present a simple spatial filtering method that takes the geometric properties of signal propagation in MEG into account, and we present methods that can process artifacts specifically encountered in an MEG-based BCI. Exemplarily, six participants were successfully trained to communicate binary decisions by imagery of limb movements using a feedback paradigm. Participants achieved significant μ-rhythm self control within 32 minutes of feedback training. For a subgroup of three participants, we localized the origin of the amplitude modulated signal to the motor cortex. Our results suggest that an MEG-based BCI is feasible and efficient in terms of user training.},

	abstract = {Background
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optical imaging technology that has recently been investigated for use in a safe, non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) for individuals with severe motor impairments. To date, most NIRS-BCI studies have attempted to discriminate two mental states (e.g., a mental task and rest), which could potentially lead to a two-choice BCI system. In this study, we attempted to automatically differentiate three mental states - specifically, intentional activity due to 1) a mental arithmetic (MA) task and 2) a mental singing (MS) task, and 3) an unconstrained, "no-control (NC)" state - to investigate the feasibility of a three-choice system-paced NIRS-BCI.

Results
Deploying a dual-wavelength frequency domain near-infrared spectrometer, we interrogated nine sites around the frontopolar locations while 7 able-bodied adults performed mental arithmetic and mental singing to answer multiple-choice questions within a system-paced paradigm. With a linear classifier trained on a ten-dimensional feature set, an overall classification accuracy of 56.2\% was achieved for the MA vs. MS vs. NC classification problem and all individual participant accuracies significantly exceeded chance (i.e., 33\%). However, as anticipated based on results of previous work, the three-class discrimination was unsuccessful for three participants due to the ineffectiveness of the mental singing task. Excluding these three participants increases the accuracy rate to 62.5\%. Even without training, three of the remaining four participants achieved accuracies approaching 70\%, the value often cited as being necessary for effective BCI communication.

Conclusions
These results are encouraging and demonstrate the potential of a three-state system-paced NIRS-BCI with two intentional control states corresponding to mental arithmetic and mental singing.},

BOLD fMRI detects local increases in relative blood oxygenation that are most probably a direct consequence of neurotransmitter action and thus reflect local neuronal signalling. The method allows localisation to volumes of the order of a few to several cubic millimetres and can be used in serial studies of individual subjects. Basic approaches to experimental design and analysis are reviewed briefly, as well as potential clinical applications. The latter include three broad areas: anatomical characterisation of normal or pathological patterns of brain functioning; distinguishing pathological traits; and monitoring treatment responses. New research is emphasising the integration of fMRI with other techniques, particularly electrophysiological. In conjunction with MRI methods for characterising pathological load, fMRI promises a refined understanding of when disease processes begin and how they can be modified by new treatments.},

It also employs a non-linear regression and post-processing technique for predicting the time-series of class labels from the spatio-spectral features.

This problem exists across different BCI approaches; a “universal” BCI that works for everyone has never been developed. Instead, about 20\% of subjects are not proficient with a typical BCI system. Some groups have called this phenomenon “BCI illiteracy”. Some possible solutions have been explored, such as improved signal processing, training, and new tasks or instructions. These approaches have not resulted in a BCI that works for all users, probably because a small minority of users cannot produce detectable patterns of brain activity necessary to a particular BCI approach. We also discuss an underappreciated solution: switching to a different BCI approach. While the term “BCI illiteracy” elicits interesting comparisons between BCIs and natural languages, many issues are unclear. For example, comparisons across different studies have been problematic since different groups use different performance thresholds, and do not account for key factors such as the number of trials or size of the BCI’s alphabet. We also discuss challenges inherent in establishing widely used terms, definitions, and measurement approaches to facilitate discussions and comparisons among different groups.},

The target face and object stimuli were presented with non-target foils that included novel face and object stimuli, the participant’s own face, their own dog (Experiment 1), and their own car (Experiment 2). The consistent findings across the two experiments were the following: (1) the N250 potential differentiated the target faces and objects from the non-target face and object foils and (2) despite being non-targets, the own face and own objects produced an N250 response that was equal in magnitude to the target faces and objects by the end of the experiment. Thus, as indicated by its response to personally familiar and recently familiarized faces and objects, the N250 component is a sensitive index of individuated representations in visual memory.},

However, previous studies typically did not include a paradigm-independent measure of either stimulus or response conflict. Here we have combined electro-myography (EMG) with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in order to determine whether a particularly robust marker of conflict processing, the N450 ERP effect usually related to the activity of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), is related to stimulus- or to response-conflict processing. EMG provided paradigm-independent measure of response conflict. In a numerical Stroop paradigm participants compared pairs of digits and pressed a button on the side where they saw the larger digit. 50\% of digit-pairs were preceded by an effective cue which provided accurate information about the required response. 50\% of trials were preceded by a neutral cue which did not communicate the side of response. Results EMG showed that response conflict was significantly larger in neutrally than in effectively cued trials. The N450 was similar when response conflict was high and when it was low. Conclusions We conclude that the N450 is related to stimulus or abstract, rather than to response conflict detection/resolution. Findings may enable timing ACC conflict effects.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The main objective of the current study was to implement and evaluate a P300 based brain–computer interface (BCI) speller that uses directional cues of auditory stimuli, which are presented over headphones. The interstimulus interval (ISI) was successively reduced to determine the optimal combination of speed and accuracy. The study further aimed at quantifying the differences in subjective workload between the auditory and the visual P300 spelling application. The influence of workload, mood and motivation on BCI performance and P300 amplitude was investigated.
Methods
Twenty healthy participants performed auditory and visual spelling tasks in an EEG experiment with online feedback.
Results
Sixteen of twenty participants performed at or above a level necessary for satisfactory communication (⩾70\% spelling accuracy) with the auditory BCI. Average bit rates of up to 2.76 bits/min (best subject 7.43 bits/min) were achieved. A significantly higher workload was reported for the auditory speller compared to the visual paradigm. Motivation significantly influenced P300 amplitude at Pz in the auditory condition.
Conclusions
The results of the online study suggest that the proposed paradigm offers a means of communication for most healthy users.
Significance
The described auditory BCI can serve as a communication channel for completely paralyzed patients.},

	abstract = {Objective. A new presentation paradigm for the P300-based brain–computer interface (BCI) referred to as the ‘asynchronous paradigm’ (ASP) is introduced and studied. It is based on the principle of performance guided constraints (Townsend et al 2012 Neurosci. Lett. 531 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2012.08.041] 63–8 ) extended from the spatial domain into the temporal domain. The traditional constraint of flashing targets in predefined constant epochs of time is eliminated and targets flash asynchronously with timing based instead on constraints intended to improve performance. Approach. We propose appropriate temporal constraints to derive the ASP and compare its performance to that of the ‘checkerboard paradigm’ (CBP), which has previously been shown to be superior to the standard ‘row/column paradigm’ introduced by Farwell and Donchin (1988 Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 70 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0013-4694(88)90149-6] 510–23 ). Ten participants were tested in the ASP and CBP conditions both with traditional flashing items and with flashing faces in place of the targets (see Zhang et al 2012 J. Neural Eng. 9 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1741-2560/9/2/026018] 026018 ; Kaufmann and Kübler 2014 J. Neural Eng. 11 [http://] ; Chen et al 2015 J. Neurosci. Methods 239 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2014.10.002] 18–27 ). Eleven minutes of calibration data were used as input to a stepwise linear discriminant analysis to derive classification coefficients used for online classification. Main results. Accuracy was consistently high for both paradigms (87\% and 93\%) while information transfer rate was 45\% higher for the ASP than the CBP. In a free spelling task, one subject spelled a 66 character sentence (from a 72 item matrix) with 100\% accuracy in 3 min and 24 s demonstrating a practical throughput of 120 bits per minute (bpm) with a theoretical upper bound of 258 bpm. The subject repeated the task three times in a row without error. Significance. This work represents an advance in P300 speller technology and raises the ceiling that was being reached on P300-based BCIs. Most importantly, the research presented here is a novel and effective general strategy for organising timing for flashing items. The ASP is only one possible implementation of this work since in general it can be used to describe all previous existing presentation paradigms as well as any possible new ones. This may be especially important for people with neuromuscular disabilities.},

Following a user-centered approach, we investigated event-related potentials (ERP) elicited in different modalities for use in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Such systems could provide her with an alternative communication channel. To investigate the most viable modality for achieving BCI based communication, classic oddball paradigms (1 rare and 1 frequent stimulus, ratio 1:5) in the visual, auditory and tactile modality were conducted (2 runs per modality). Classifiers were built on one run and tested offline on another run (and vice versa). In these paradigms, the tactile modality was clearly superior to other modalities, displaying high offline accuracy even when classification was performed on single trials only. Consequently, we tested the tactile paradigm online and the patient successfully selected targets without any error. Furthermore, we investigated use of the visual or tactile modality for different BCI systems with more than two selection options. In the visual modality, several BCI paradigms were tested offline. Neither matrix-based nor so-called gaze-independent paradigms constituted a means of control. These results may thus question the gaze-independence of current gaze-independent approaches to BCI. A tactile four-choice BCI resulted in high offline classification accuracies. Yet, online use raised various issues. Although performance was clearly above chance, practical daily life use appeared unlikely when compared to other communication approaches (e.g., partner scanning). Our results emphasize the need for user-centered design in BCI development including identification of the best stimulus modality for a particular user. Finally, the paper discusses feasibility of EEG-based BCI systems for patients in classic locked-in state and compares BCI to other AT solutions that we also tested during the study.},

As a potential remedy, we explored a novel BCI paradigm consisting of a central rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of the stimuli. It has a large vocabulary and realizes a BCI system based on covert non-spatial selective visual attention. In an offline study, eight participants were presented sequences of rapid bursts of symbols. Two different speeds and two different color conditions were investigated. Robust early visual and P300 components were elicited time-locked to the presentation of the target.

	abstract = {Objective
A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) speller is a communication device, which can be used by patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases to select symbols in a computer application. For patients unable to overtly fixate the target symbol, it is crucial to develop a speller independent of gaze shifts. In the present online study, we investigated rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) as a paradigm for mental typewriting.
Methods
We investigated the RSVP speller in three conditions, regarding the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) and the use of color features. A vocabulary of 30 symbols was presented one-by-one in a pseudo random sequence at the same location of display.
Results
All twelve participants were able to successfully operate the RSVP speller. The results show a mean online spelling rate of 1.43 symb/min and a mean symbol selection accuracy of 94.8\% in the best condition.
Conclusion
We conclude that the RSVP is a promising paradigm for BCI spelling and its performance is competitive with the fastest gaze-independent spellers in literature.
Significance
The RSVP speller does not require gaze shifts towards different target locations and can be operated by non-spatial visual attention, therefore it can be considered as a valid paradigm in applications with patients for impaired oculo-motor control.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a novel brain–computer interface (BCI) based on an oddball paradigm using stimuli of facial images with loss of configural face information (e.g., inversion of face). To the best of our knowledge, till now the configural processing of human faces has not been applied to BCI but widely studied in cognitive neuroscience research. Our experiments confirm that the face-sensitive event-related potential (ERP) components N170 and vertex positive potential (VPP) have reflected early structural encoding of faces and can be modulated by the configural processing of faces. With the proposed novel paradigm, we investigate the effects of ERP components N170, VPP and P300 on target detection for BCI. An eight-class BCI platform is developed to analyze ERPs and evaluate the target detection performance using linear discriminant analysis without complicated feature extraction processing. The online classification accuracy of 88.7\% and information transfer rate of 38.7 bits min −1 using stimuli of inverted faces with only single trial suggest that the proposed paradigm based on the configural processing of faces is very promising for visual stimuli-driven BCI applications.},

	abstract = {Background
It was proved that the human face stimulus were superior to the flash only stimulus in BCI system. However, human face stimulus may lead to copyright infringement problems and was hard to be edited according to the requirement of the BCI study. Recently, it was reported that facial expression changes could be done by changing a curve in a dummy face which could obtain good performance when it was applied to visual-based P300 BCI systems.
New method
In this paper, four different paradigms were presented, which were called dummy face pattern, human face pattern, inverted dummy face pattern and inverted human face pattern, to evaluate the performance of the dummy faces stimuli compared with the human faces stimuli.
Comparison with existing method(s)
The key point that determined the value of dummy faces in BCI systems were whether dummy faces stimuli could obtain as good performance as human faces stimuli. Online and offline results of four different paradigms would have been obtained and comparatively analyzed.
Results
Online and offline results showed that there was no significant difference among dummy faces and human faces in ERPs, classification accuracy and information transfer rate when they were applied in BCI systems.
Conclusions
Dummy faces stimuli could evoke large ERPs and obtain as high classification accuracy and information transfer rate as the human faces stimuli. Since dummy faces were easy to be edited and had no copyright infringement problems, it would be a good choice for optimizing the stimuli of BCI systems.},

	abstract = {The individual properties of visual objects, like form or color, are represented in different areas in our visual cortex. In order to perceive one coherent object, its features have to be bound together. This was found to be achieved in cat and monkey brains by temporal correlation of the firing rates of neurons which code the same object. This firing rate is predominantly observed in the gamma frequency range (approx. 30-80 Hz, mainly around 40 Hz). In addition, it has been shown in humans that stimuli which flicker at gamma frequencies are processed faster by our brains than when they flicker at different frequencies. These effects could be due to neural oscillators, which preferably oscillate at certain frequencies, so-called resonance frequencies. It is also known that neurons in visual cortex respond to flickering stimuli at the frequency of the flickering light. If neural oscillators exist with resonance frequencies, they should respond more strongly to stimulation with their resonance frequency. We performed an experiment, where ten human subjects were presented flickering light at frequencies from 1 to 100 Hz in 1-Hz steps. The event-related potentials exhibited steady-state oscillations at all frequencies up to at least 90 Hz. Interestingly, the steady-state potentials exhibited clear resonance phenomena around 10, 20, 40 and 80 Hz. This could be a potential neural basis for gamma oscillations in binding experiments. The pattern of results resembles that of multiunit activity and local field potentials in cat visual cortex.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This report summarizes background material presented to a consensus conference on visually provoked seizures, convened by the Epilepsy Foundation of America.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of literature was performed.
RESULTS: Photosensitivity, an abnormal EEG response to light or pattern stimulation, occurs in approximately 0.3-3\% of the population. The estimated prevalence of seizures from light stimuli is approximately 1 per 10,000, or 1 per 4,000 individuals age 5-24 years. People with epilepsy have a 2-14\% chance of having seizures precipitated by light or pattern. In the Pokemon cartoon incident in Japan, 685 children visited a hospital in reaction to red-blue flashes on broadcast television (TV). Only 24\% who had a seizure during the cartoon had previously experienced a seizure. Photic or pattern stimulation can provoke seizures in predisposed individuals, but such stimulation is not known to increase the chance of subsequent epilepsy. Intensities of 0.2-1.5 million candlepower are in the range to trigger seizures. Frequencies of 15-25 Hz are most provocative, but the range is 1-65 Hz. Light-dark borders can induce pattern-sensitive seizures, and red color also is a factor. Seizures can be provoked by certain TV shows, movie screen images, video games, natural stimuli (e.g, sun on water), public displays, and many other sources.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations on reducing risk of seizures have been developed by agencies in the United Kingdom, Japan, and the International Telecommunications Union, affiliated with the United Nations. The Epilepsy Foundation of America has developed a consensus of medical experts and scientists on this subject, reported in an accompanying work.},

The view is taken that success in Psychophysiology should be measured by the degree to which psychophysiological data can be used in elucidating the processes that underly the behavioral product rather than by the enumeration of psychophysiological “correlates” of behavior. It is proposed that endogenous ERP components are best viewed as manifestations of the activities of “subroutines” invoked during the informational transactions of the brain. A theoretical account of an ERP component consists of the specification of the functional role of the subroutine it manifests. Studies of the P300 components are examined for the contribution they make to the development of such a theory of the P300. Experiments focusing on P300 latency and amplitude are reviewed and it is concluded that P300 may be a manifestation of the processes whereby schemas are revised. The relationship between P300 and the Orienting Reflex is discussed within the framework of this model. It is suggested that P300 amplitude may predict the memorability of events. A preliminary test of this prediction is described.},

Paying attention selectively to either the red or blue dot population produced an enhanced amplitude of its frequency-tagged SSVEP, which was localized by source modeling to early levels of the visual cortex. A control experiment showed that this selection was based on color rather than flicker frequency cues. This signal amplification of attended color items provides an empirical basis for the rapid identification of feature conjunctions during visual search, as proposed by “guided search” models.},

In all cases, we aim to develop a system that could be used for fast, reliable preliminary screening in clinical BCI application, and we are interested in knowing how long screening sessions need to be. Good performance could be achieved, on average, after the first 200 trials in EEG, 75–100 trials in MEG, or 25–50 trials in ECoG. We compare the performance of Independent Component Analysis and the Common Spatial Pattern algorithm in each of the three sensor types, finding that spatial filtering does not help in MEG, helps a little in ECoG, and improves performance a great deal in EEG. In all cases the unsupervised ICA algorithm performed at least as well as the supervised CSP algorithm, which can suffer from poor generalization performance due to overfitting, particularly in ECoG and MEG.},

	issn = {0169-2607},
	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260715002217},
	doi = {10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.08.011},
	abstract = {Background and objective
The aim of this paper is to provide an efficient, parametric, general, and completely automatic real time classification method of electroencephalography (EEG) signals obtained from self-induced emotions. The particular characteristics of the considered low-amplitude signals (a self-induced emotion produces a signal whose amplitude is about 15\% of a really experienced emotion) require exploring and adapting strategies like the Wavelet Transform, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for signal processing, analysis and classification. Moreover, the method is thought to be used in a multi-emotions based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and, for this reason, an ad hoc shrewdness is assumed.
Method
The peculiarity of the brain activation requires ad-hoc signal processing by wavelet decomposition, and the definition of a set of features for signal characterization in order to discriminate different self-induced emotions. The proposed method is a two stages algorithm, completely parameterized, aiming at a multi-class classification and may be considered in the framework of machine learning. The first stage, the calibration, is off-line and is devoted at the signal processing, the determination of the features and at the training of a classifier. The second stage, the real-time one, is the test on new data. The PCA theory is applied to avoid redundancy in the set of features whereas the classification of the selected features, and therefore of the signals, is obtained by the SVM.
Results
Some experimental tests have been conducted on EEG signals proposing a binary BCI, based on the self-induced disgust produced by remembering an unpleasant odor. Since in literature it has been shown that this emotion mainly involves the right hemisphere and in particular the T8 channel, the classification procedure is tested by using just T8, though the average accuracy is calculated and reported also for the whole set of the measured channels.
Conclusions
The obtained classification results are encouraging with percentage of success that is, in the average for the whole set of the examined subjects, above 90\%. An ongoing work is the application of the proposed procedure to map a large set of emotions with EEG and to establish the EEG headset with the minimal number of channels to allow the recognition of a significant range of emotions both in the field of affective computing and in the development of auxiliary communication tools for subjects affected by severe disabilities.},

The manifold view comes with a natural distance function but the conic view does not. Thus, drawing motivation from convex optimization we introduce the S-divergence, a distance-like function on the cone of hpd matrices. We study basic properties of the S-divergence and explore its connections to the Riemannian distance. In particular, we show that (i) its square-root is a distance, and (ii) it exhibits numerous nonpositive-curvature-like properties.},
